# Nutshell Installer
An installer for disposable, containerized applications.

For further information on how to use Nutshell Installer, visit our documentation page [here.](https://nutshell.me)

Nutshell Installer allows you to access your favourite apps - from web browsers, to office tools, to entire desktops - in a way where each session is destroyed when closed.

These applications also feature isolation from your device core systems through the power of Docker containers and Linuxserver.io webtops, meaning hackers won't so easily be able to access what's precious to you.

## Nutshell Installer features both Disposable and Persistent Applications.

In short, disposable applications are your everyday programs - from web browsers, to office tools, to whole other desktops - which self-destruct when you close them.

This ensures third parties cannot maintain a trace on your data, keeping you safe and anonymous as you go about your daily tasks.

Disposable application also have the benefit of being opened in their own ecosystem, separate from the host machine.

Though persistent applications also have this "containerized" feature that keeps them separate from your computer, they will not get destroyed upon closing. Thus, we recommend installation of disposable applications.

## Installation

There are two ways to approach the installation of Nutshell:

1. Download the Nutshell Operating System
2. Download the Nutshell Installer

Nutshell OS comes fully-featured, with some addons - installation instructions are found [here.](https://nutshellos.me)

This section details installation of Nutshell Installer itself, for usage on your current OS.

### Installing Nutshell Installer

1. Clone the repository, and extract the files to your Desktop.
2. Open the command window in your Desktop, and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` - this installs all the necessary packages to run the installer.
3. Open another tab in your web browser and type: "download docker for {Your OS}"
4. Follow the link to the Docker site, and download it.
5. Execute the "main.py" file in the "Nutshell_Config" folder - the Installer UI should appear.

**NOTE:** For easier access, consider making a Desktop shortcut for the "main.py" file.

## Using the Installer

There are two buttons you should familiarise yourself with: Application Search and Manage Applications.

### Application Search

This button takes you to another window, asking whether you want to view Disposable or Persistent applications. Select whichever option you prefer.

A new window should pop up. Here, you can browse for whatever one of our programs you'd like to install - here is a list of them below:

1. Firefox Browser
2. Chromium Browser
3. Opera Browser
4. Ubuntu Desktop
5. Fedora Desktop
6. Arch Desktop
7. Debian Desktop
8. Alpine Desktop
9. LibreOffice Suite

Found an app you want? Click on its icon.

Once it's been installed, you'll see a new Python file/shortcut appear on the Desktop. Click on it - note that the first boot will take a couple of minutes to initiate. **Do not get impatient!**

After a while, the program should start up.


### Manage Applications

This button takes you to a page where you can view all your existing applications. When you click on a specific app's icon, you'll be able to see when you first built it.

Additionally, there is a button providing you the option to uninstall a program. Should you wish to do so, simply click the button and select "OK" in the popup window.

## Conclusion

While Nutshell OS is not a perfect system, it aims to improve the quality of security in our daily lives - for in the Digital Age, nothing is more important than ensuring everything we love dearly is kept safe.
